# Welcome to Haze Muziek Studio Amsterdam.
Hello, my name is **Vitor Venturin**, born in **Brazil** and grandson of Italians.

I've been interested in **programming** since childhood and during my professional career I have built strong **apps** for private banks such as ItaÃº and Banco Safra. 
Living in **Amsterdam** since July 2017, worked as **iOS developer** for forward-thinking companies I decided to open a music studio at West of Amsterdam and I call it **Haze Muziek** - a placed called home where I can **record** my **songs** and also create ideas for **AI**, **bots**, **audio apps**, **IoT** and **Machine Learning**.

I have **wide experience** in **software development** for **Apple** devices and during my professional career I have created different **applications** (from **games** to **banking solutions**) and now looking forward to a **Master Degree in Machine Learning**.

I am slowly planning to upload some of audio experimentation projects here.
