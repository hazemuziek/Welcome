# Welcome to Haze Muziek Studio Amsterdam.
Hello, my name is **Vitor Venturin**, born in **Brazil** and grandson of Italians.  
I've been interested in **programming** since childhood and during my professional career I have built strong **apps** for many corporations around the world.  
Living in **Amsterdam** since July 2017 and after working as **iOS developer** for forward-thinking companies I decided to setup my own music homestudio at West of Amsterdam: The **Haze Muziek** studio is a place where I can **record** my **songs** and also develop ideas for **AI**, **bots**, **audio apps** exploring new fields such as **Internet of Things** and **Machine Learning**.  
I have **wide experience** in **software development** for **Apple** devices and during my professional career I have created different **applications** (from **games** to **banking solutions**) and now looking forward to a **Master Degree in Machine Learning**.  
I am slowly planning to upload some of audio experimentation projects here.<br>
For now, enjoy the links below and contact me for a smart coffee ðŸ“© vitorventurin@gmail.com
