# Welcome to Haze Muziek Studio Amsterdam.
Hello, my name is **Vitor Venturin**, I am living in **Amsterdam** since July 2017 and after working as **iOS developer** for forward-thinking companies I decided to setup my own music homestudio at West of Amsterdam: The **Haze Muziek** studio. <br>
As musician, I use my space to arrange, compose and **record** original songs, but not only that, I also develop ideas for **AI**, **bots**, **audio apps** and use my big database of sounds to explore new fields like **Internet of Things** and **Machine Learning**.  
I've been interested in **programming** since childhood and during my professional career I have built strong **apps** for many corporations around the world.  I have **wide experience** in **software development** for **Apple** devices and during my professional career I have created different **applications** (from **games** to **banking solutions**) and now looking forward to a **Master Degree in Machine Learning**.  
PS: that is a work in progress. I am slowly planning to upload some of audio experimentation projects here.<br>
For now, enjoy the links below and call me for a coffee 📩 vitorventurin@gmail.com
